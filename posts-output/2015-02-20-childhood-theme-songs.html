    <h2>Childhood (French) Theme Songs!</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>Goofed around pretty much all day; the post below is pretty much all I have to show for it.</p><p>Today I looked up all the theme songs of childhood TV shows that I used to like. I lived in France from 6-8 and so the theme songs from that time are of course in French.</p><h1 id="bioman">Bioman</h1><p><div class="center"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbg-InH7EGo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><div></p><p>This show was really popular when I was young. By my recollection, it was basically just Mighty Morphing Power Rangers done on a lower budget (is such a thing possible?). I thought the show itself was pretty stupid, but this is basically what we would spend our time playing as. It was dubbed into French, all the actors were Asian (I assume Japanese). It had something to do with fighting a mad scientist and gengineered humans who could each summon a portion of a fighting robot. The video above isn't actually the opening theme, but it is the one that every kid associated with Bioman. The actual opener wasn't all that great.</p><h1 id="le&#95;chevalier&#95;du&#95;zodiac">Le Chevalier du Zodiac</h1><p><div class="center"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MF<i>5O</i>wsVyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p><p>This show was a phenomena in France. Every boy I knew owned at least a few of the figures from this series. If you accidently broke a piece on the intricate and fragile toy figure, there was going to be waterworks that day. Young boys just flat out loved this series. It was an obsession among my age group. I have vague recollections of the characters fighting older men a lot of the time. By my memory, they just permuted on fight after fight after fight. Again, I don't think this was the actual opener (it is too long) but it is the one I remember from my memory. Also, interestingly enough, it is the same guy who sings the Bioman song. I don't know what is up with that. All I know is that every boy could sing this song.</p><h1 id="ken&#95;le&#95;survivant&#95;de&#95;la&#95;terre&#95;l'enfer">Ken Le Survivant de la Terre l'enfer</h1><p><div class="center"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-NV7FG3974" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></p><p>In my memory, he was "The survivor of Earth", but it turns out he survived Hell. Funny how memory works. This was probably the most violent show I would watch as a child. Ken was pretty hardcore, he would get jacked up and stick his fingers into people somehow killing them with (Tai Chi?) pressure points. He also was very fond of making "ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka" noises whenever he rapid fire punched/kicked/whatever. Naturally, whenever any group of boys play fought, we always had to make the noises Ken made when he fought. It must have sounded like a group of birds dying.</p><h1 id="galaxy&#95;express&#95;999">Galaxy Express 999</h1><p><div class="center"> <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F2yV7T_1YkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div></p><p>I have no real memory of Galaxy Express 999 being very popular. I am pretty sure that it was an older series. I don't think that any of my friends were into it that much. I liked it a good deal, as it involved lots of robots and a woman that a young boy is basically in love with. I am not entirely sure, but I think the woman may have looked like a physical education teacher whom I fancied. Anyway, the theme was straight up metal. Whenever I try to remember how numbers work in French, I always humm "Galaxy Express neuf san quatre vingt dix neuve" (9<em>100 "neuf-san" + 4</em>20 "quatre-vingt" + "dix" 10 "neuve" 9). Not that it comes up that often, but there it is.</p>
