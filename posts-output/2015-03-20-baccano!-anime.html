    <h2>Baccano!</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>I really liked the Watchmen movie, I was already a fan of the comic book beforehand. However, post movie, I could definitely see how the movie might not be as appealing had I not read the source material. Baccano! is based on a light novel series that I have not read. The anime felt like it was eliding over the source material. I enjoyed it, but had some real problems with the plot.</p><p>This anime had more loose threads than I could count. Almost none of the stories had a beginning or end. I get that the anime was going for that exact device, but it isn't personally something I am fond of.</p><p>Maybe if you read the source material the plot makes more sense. I hope so.</p><p>I think animes like this may actually illustrate a dividing lines between narrative fandom. People like myself just can't help thinking about things like plot, logical sense, rational behavior, character intelligence, backstory, etc. I am, for lack of a better word, a mechanical/deterministic kind of guy. Things just have to make sense or I feel unease. Baccano! is more about mood, feeling, excitement, connection, emotion; it does not feel that it has to make sense.</p><p>I have a few recomendations.</p><ol><li>Watch only the first 13 episodes. The last (14-16) are rubbish and practically nonsensical.</li><li>Appreciate the art and the style that went into this. I was especially impressed by the attention to details in the set pieces and the characters clothing. I liked the outfits a good deal, as they were clearly inspired from the 1930's but actually morphed to be attractive by modern standards.</li><li>The music is catchy, the opening credit scene is actually well done.</li><li>Note the fact that somebody built an anime without using most of the conventional tropes of the genre.</li><li>Might consider reading the novels beforehand. I have not, but I felt I might enjoy the series more had I done so.</li><li>I watched the sub (arrogant purist that I am), but evidently the English dub is actually quite good. Might be worth giving it a shot.</li><li>Finally, I watched this series over maybe 10 days, watching an episode or two a day. I would instead recommend watching this over a weekend. There are a lot of characters and interactions all over the place. It can be easier to remember who was what if it is all "fresh" in your head.</li></ol><p><div class="center"> <img src="/img/baccano.jpg"/> </div></p>
