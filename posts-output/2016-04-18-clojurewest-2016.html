    <h2>Clojure / West 2016</h2>
</div>
<div>
    
    <p>A recording of all that I saw and hear at Clojure West 2016 in Seattle Washington.</p><h2 id="nathan&#95;marz&#95;specter">Nathan Marz Specter</h2><p><a href='https://github.com/nathanmarz/specter'>Github</a></p><ol><li>Navigation is independent abstraction</li><li>Navigation dissasociated from the desired transformation</li><li>Provides type defined defaults for navigation to nil</li><li>Assuming you can write a generic enough function</li></ol><p>This library lets you navigate and modify deeply nested and deeply repetitive data structures. Fundamently, it raises the barrier before you need to start putting things in a database by making it possible to just reason about data when the data is very deep or very broad. It makes the actionable code look like a DSL in its conciseness; without actually being a DSL. Having said that, it is bringing in a rather large "mini DSL" in order to allow for the data manipulation.</p><h2 id="donevan&#95;dolby">Donevan Dolby</h2><p>This was a walkthrough of a 16,000 line of code Clojure App. Lessons were learned, libraries were used, and discarded. Code is being used on the Boeing 737 MAX; which is evidently a new plane with a focus on efficiency.</p><h2 id="claire&#95;alvis">Claire Alvis</h2><p>https://github.com/SparkFund/spec-tacular</p><p>An attempt at putting some sort of stronger typing on entities in Datomic. Graded various aspects of her attempt. Did not entirely follow due to lack of familiarity with Typed systems in particular.</p><ol><li>Adds types in to Datomic by having a spectacular shema -> becomes datomic schema</li><li>Verification of code</li><li>Documentation is specified by the spec</li></ol><h2 id="michał&#95;marczyk">Michał Marczyk</h2><p>This was just a deep dive into exactly what a record is and when it is appropriate to use one. A record is just a collection of fields, possibly of different data types, typicially with a fixed number and sequences.</p><h4 id="records&#95;also&#95;takes&#95;types&#95;into&#95;account&#95;(.equals&#95;and&#95;.hashcode)">Records also takes types into account (.equals and .hashCode)</h4><p>Big exception is that <code>=</code> and <code>.equals</code> are NOT the same when comparing Record to a map even with the same value.</p><h4 id="dissoc&#95;a&#95;key&#95;from&#95;a&#95;record&#95;returns&#95;a&#95;map">dissoc a key from a Record returns a Map</h4><p>It can be a bit surprising to see this. Unfortunately, they often still look like records. In fact, this is one of the reason record? exist.</p><h4 id="reasons&#95;you&#95;might&#95;use&#95;records">Reasons you might use records</h4><ol><li>Clear data semantics (you are naming things) (clara-rules)</li><li>computed properties (midpoint of a circle, IShape, Circle, Rectangle)) (core.async)</li><li>polymorphic 'actions'  (Stuart Sierra's component)</li><li>A clean simple way to create a named class implementating a interface</li><li>(defrecord ForJava [...]:load-ns true...)</li></ol><h2 id="mario&#95;aquino">Mario Aquino</h2><p>Showcased an API for interaction to the Alexa Skill system from the Clojure API. It is called Boomhauer, from the king of the hill character. <a href='https://github.com/TheClimateCorporation/boomhauer'>GITHUB</a></p><ol><li>Interactions can be single exchange or can be stateful</li><li>Alexa has two concepts Intent and slots<ul><li>Intent - What you want to do GETHOROSCOPE</li><li>Slots - The "arguments" passed to a</li></ul></li><li>Uterances - How you might express the things you are interested in eg.</li><li>There is a local development that you can do</li><li>Mobile could provide a great way to make Alexa a real success.</li><li>There are libraries that generate all the uterances you want from a grammar.</li><li>There is a Certification process. Got to get approved like Mac Application.</li></ol><p>This might be good for the sales reps. I mean, they are already wearing a headset, it would be cool if they could do things like take voice notes and make calls and all that stuff without even having to touch the screen.</p><h2 id="michael&#95;drogalis">Michael Drogalis</h2><ol><li>"Peerless" in the sense that peers open direct line of communication between each other</li><li>Zookeeper for keeping track of the entry's that have been added</li></ol><p>I have no use for this, thought it was neat. It is basically a system for doing distributed computation in a peerless system.</p><h2 id="jack&#95;dubie">Jack Dubie</h2><h4 id="hiearchy&#95;of&#95;testing&#95;-&#95;[decoupled,&#95;end&#95;to&#95;end,&#95;lightweight,&#95;simple]">Hiearchy of testing - [Decoupled, End to End, Lightweight, Simple]</h4><ol><li>Unit Test</li><li>API Test</li><li>UI Test (Selenium) - Just test what is supposed to happen</li></ol><h4 id="how&#95;do&#95;you&#95;test&#95;that&#95;something&#95;was&#95;done&#95;without&#95;actually&#95;tying&#95;to&#95;a&#95;particular&#95;db?">How do you test that something was done without actually tying to a particular db?</h4><p>Refresh the page after performing an action, you should have the same state as you had when you finished.

o - takes you out of the current debugger
s - stacktraces
which-key package -
http://cider.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
there is a really good story in terms of being able to trace recursive functions
enlighten mode basically enables lightable in emacs
cider-scratchpad is usual for prototyping ideas
C-c C-e for normal evaluation
C-j to print out the result
cider-inspect lets you look at complex data
cider-docs - to see docs
cider-grimoir - to see examples
cider-apropo - match all symbols related to the word you name
Projectile installed allows you to toggle between implementation and test

Met a number of people that we can bring in to work if we need their skills. Learned about new technologies in the Clojure community. Specifically, I think the Alexa system might be something we should look into for Reps. Specter might be good for keeping our system as Data and not needing to put everything in a database. The Data science team might like that; of course, it would involve learning clojure. I think that would be a win win for everyone. :]</p>
