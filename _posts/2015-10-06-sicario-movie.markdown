Saw "Sicario" this evening. It was a pretty decent flick. It actually made me think of the sub movie I watched a while ago called "Black Sea".

It left you witht the same kind of tense feeling in your neck as that movie. I guess, I guess I enjoy movies like that.

Message was I suppose a reflection on the nature of violence, the war on drugs, the power structure of states, etc. It wasn't about anything in particular so much as a slice of life look at a very messed up real life situation. Now, I imagine it is somewhat dramatized, but it is real.
