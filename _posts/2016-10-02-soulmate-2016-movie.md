> A gorgeously shot, tear-stained love letter to female friendship that also provides a fascinating look into contemporary, urban China. - Cary Darling

The above represents the entirety of my knowledge concerning this film. I think it was "contemporary, urban China" that really capture my interest. I really like movies that might give me some idea of what a foreign country/culture/people are like. Films of this type are harder to find than you would imagine. Very few people capture their own culture in film. Most film capture an idealized version of a culture (for the protagonist), or a lampooned version (for our antagonist). 

Most recent example I can think of to date was [Hell or High Water](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hell_or_high_water/), which really capture the manerism/desperation/stagnation of some of West Texas.

Soulmate is a Chinese movie that details the lifelong friendship of two women. Stated as such, does not sound like much?

It isn't so much the velocity though, it is the rate of change. It is the fact that the characters actually change through time. I feel like modern cinema is so concerned with having "strong" and "noble" characters that we harden them to the point that they are as mechanical as the plot. I really appreciated the fact, over years, the two main characters change. That is really an ambitios thing to try to make a movie about. 

The camera work was also fresh. The shots were consistenly set up in interesting ways. People looking across each other in bed. Slow motion scenes to capture moments of youth (implying memory). Though there were a number of talking head scenes; however, I felt like I was often getting a sense of the room, of the space, even within those scenes. I lack the vocabulary to acurately describe what I was seeing, but I could feel it. Somebody really thought hard about how to set up scenes that fit the on screen action.

Reminded me a bit of [Our Little Sister](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/our_little_sister/), though less maudlin. Anway, long story short, I thought it was a great movie. It was interesting, I was engaged, and the acting was fantastic.
