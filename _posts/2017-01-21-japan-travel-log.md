Today starts my 3 week tour of Japan. I'll try to take pictures and record a few observations every day here.

I am going to give [Google Trips](https://get.google.com/trips/) a shot. I don't have much in the way of an itinerary. I mostly plan on traveling around as the mood strikes. I have bought a [Japan Rail Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) (Green) so I will also detail what riding the various trains was like. I have [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/account) for phone service, so that shouldn't be a problem. I also bought a [Tortuga Outbreaker 35L](http://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpack?variant=26900597257), which I am hoping makes the trip that much more enjoyable. Finally, I bought some [Bose QuietComfort 35](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E3SNO1G/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) headphones for the plane ride, the train rides, and all the time in between.

It is a lot of purchases, and I am interested in rating how much each contributed to the pleasure of the trip.
