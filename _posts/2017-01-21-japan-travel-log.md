Today starts my 3 week tour of Japan. I'll try to take pictures and record a few observations every day here.

Techs I am trying:
* I am going to give [Google Trips](https://get.google.com/trips/) a shot. Supposedly it can dynamically arrange schedule of things to do every day. Sounds kind of neat.
* I don't have much in the way of an itinerary. I mostly plan on traveling around as the mood strikes. I have bought a [Japan Rail Pass](http://www.japanrailpass.net/en/) (Green) so I will also detail what riding the various trains was like.
* I have [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/account) for phone service, so that shouldn't be a problem.
* I bought a [Tortuga Outbreaker 35L](http://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/outbreaker-travel-backpack?variant=26900597257), which I am hoping makes the trip that much more enjoyable. It means no checked baggage and a pretty easy time carrying things around (no wheels!). However, it mean't that I did not have enough space to pack a suite and dress shoes.
* I recently bought some [Bose QuietComfort 35](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E3SNO1G/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) headphones for work. And I will evaluate them for travel.

It is a lot of purchases, and I am interested in rating how much each contributed to the pleasure of the trip.
