The [Chrome Dev Summit 2016](https://developer.chrome.com/devsummit/) was this last Thursday and Friday. "Progressive" web apps, is a set of standards/technologies that allow your web application to "progress" to a native app. The kind of app that has a button on your phones home screen.

# Reception

I always wish I lived in the future. My suspicion is that most IOS and Android programming will be obsoleted rapidly once AR technology comes out. What is used to program AR interfaces is currently undecided. I think the uptake on AR is probably going to be much faster than even the uptake on cell phones. 

.... Anyway.

I program for the web. I don't have any desire to program in Swift or Java. I think those technologies are probably at their peak usage. Outside of gaming, phone browsers are good enough to emulate the functionality of most native apps (huge amount of hand waving here). Native apps are sticky in a way that web sites are not. Progressive Web Apps give you the ability to continue programming for the web, but get the stickiness that a native app receives.
