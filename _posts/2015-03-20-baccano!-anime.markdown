I really liked the Watchmen movie, I was already a fan of the comic book beforehand. However, post movie, I could definitely see how the movie might not be as appealing had I not read the source material. Baccano! is based on a light novel series that I have not read. The anime felt like it was eliding over the source material. I enjoyed it, but had some real problems with the plot.

This anime had more loose threads than I could count. Almost none of the stories had a beginning or end. I get that the anime was going for that exact device, but it isn't personally something I am fond of.

Maybe if you read the source material the plot makes more sense. I hope so.

I think animes like this may actually illustrate a dividing lines between narrative fandom. People like myself just can't help thinking about things like plot, logical sense, rational behavior, character intelligence, backstory, etc. I am, for lack of a better word, a mechanical/deterministic kind of guy. Things just have to make sense or I feel unease. Baccano! is more about mood, feeling, excitement, connection, emotion; it does not feel that it has to make sense.

I have a few recomendations.

1) Watch only the first 13 episodes. The last (14-16) are rubbish and practically nonsensical.
2) Appreciate the art and the style that went into this. I was especially impressed by the attention to details in the set pieces and the characters clothing. I liked the outfits a good deal, as they were clearly inspired from the 1930's but actually morphed to be attractive by modern standards.
3) The music is catchy, the opening credit scene is actually well done.
4) Note the fact that somebody built an anime without using most of the conventional tropes of the genre.
5) Might consider reading the novels beforehand. I have not, but I felt I might enjoy the series more had I done so.
6) I watched the sub (arrogant purist that I am), but evidently the English dub is actually quite good. Might be worth giving it a shot.
7) Finally, I watched this series over maybe 10 days, watching an episode or two a day. I would instead recommend watching this over a weekend. There are a lot of characters and interactions all over the place. It can be easier to remember who was what if it is all "fresh" in your head.
