# Rocksmith Scripts

I would like to play the guitar. I have no musical training. I would have trouble finding the time for lessons. Solution, [Rocksmith 2014](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221680/).

## Scripts

### Startup
Modern games should not force me to go through multiple menus of unskippable
bullshit just to get the game started. This script will start Rocksmith 2014
and then press the keys necessary to skip the Uplay login nonsense.
### Recording
This starts your Shadowplay streaming service. I am doing this to provide a
recording of every practice session I have had.
### Shutdown
Attempt to use the keyboard to gracefully close the game. If this fails it then
hard kill the game.
### Uploading
The final script just uploads the recording to Youtube. The recording is then
deleted.
### All
This script just runs the above 4 scripts in order. You can set it to run at
a specific time by doing the following.
