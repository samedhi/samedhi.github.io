I am constantly attempting to set up new habits. What I found intriguing about the first video is that it unified the notion of habits and the notion of self. I have always viewed my habits as external things, there is me and then there are my habits. I am attempting to start this good habit. I am attempting to give up this bad habit. Etc. 

It is a powerful shift in perception to consider that you are a collection of habits. That the emergent notion of you is a complex interweaving of habits; some so fundamental that you have "subsumed" them into your definition of self. 

Taken to the logical extreme, addiction is nothing more than an extremely ingrained habit. Weird thought.

Actionably, I find it comforting to consider that all reactions to the world are just a matter of habits. Skills are habits by another name, addictions are habits that have become too ingrained. All problems can be tackled by thinking of them as habits that need to be internalized (or broken) to allow you to get to your desired outcome.

The second related video is as a critic of the notion of "Acceptance". Acceptance (as Westerner's define it) involves conditioning yourself to be comfortable with your life. At some level this is a very dangerous idea. Acceptance is a process of conditioning yourself to be comfortable with your current habits.
