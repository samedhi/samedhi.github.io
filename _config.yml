  A journal of what I am working on and thinking about. I provide here
  links to every project I work upon. I also periodically review things,
  and sometimes, if you are good, give my opinion. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://samedhi.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
